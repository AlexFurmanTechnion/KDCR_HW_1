function [q_dot] = q_dot_plan(q, v, T, method, params)

% General Description:
%   This function returns a matrix with each column representing a 
%   vector of the derivatives of the joint positions with respect to time
%   at a particular time t_i

% Parameters:
% q - matrix of joint position vectors (found previously using q_plan)
% v - matrix of velocity vectors of the tool vector over T seconds
% method - user specifies whether to calculate q_dot numerically, or using
%          analytical definition of x_dot = JL*q_dot
% T-time taken to move from x0 to xf
% params=[H,l2,l3]
