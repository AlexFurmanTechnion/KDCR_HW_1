function [q_dot2] = q_dot2_plan(q, q_dot, a, T, method, params)

% General Description:
%   This function returns a matrix with each column representing a 
%   vector of the derivatives of the joint positions with respect to time
%   at a particular time t_i

% Parameters:
% q - matrix of joint position vectors (found previously using q_plan)
% q_dot - matrix of joint velocity vectors (found previously using q_dot_plan)
% a - matrix of velocity vectors of the tool vector over T seconds
% method - user specifies whether to calculate q_dot numerically, or using
%          analytical definition of x_dot2 -JL_dot*q = JL*q_dot2
% T-time taken to move from x0 to xf
% params=[H,l2,l3]
[~, colnum] = size(q);
q_dot2 = zeros(3, colnum);
JL = zeros(3, 3, colnum);
JL_dot = zeros(3, 3, colnum);
